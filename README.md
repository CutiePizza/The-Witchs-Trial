## Introduction
This is my graduation project for Holberton School, a project-based, peer learning full stack software engineering school. I created a little VR game in which the player becomes a witch and will have to pass a trial to prove their worth as one. If failed, the witch will have her powers removed and live as a simple human (You shall not worry I am sure you can pass ðŸ˜‰).

## Description
The game is set up in a beautiful fantasy world, full of magic and different creatures. The player, whom is a witch, will go through multiple tests (levels). Each test is timed and is different from the other as it evaluates everytime an ability of the witch.

<p align="center">_This game is designed to have multiple levels, because of time scope only one has been made for now. more will come in the future._</p>

## Level one : Flying trial
For the first test, the witch has to reach the final line within the time limit and have collected 10 diamonds by flying on a broom.
The course is made up of :
- **Pink rings :** Adds 3 seconds to the timer.
- **Red rings :** Substracts 5 seconds from the timer.
- **Asteroids :** If you bumped into them, a dimaond is taken from the witch.
